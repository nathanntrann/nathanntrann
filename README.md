- 👋 Hi, I’m @nathanntrann  
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, embedded systems, and building intelligent, real-world applications that merge software with hardware.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced transformer models, FreeRTOS integration, and how to train ML models for embedded code generation.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI + embedded projects, open source tooling for safety-critical systems, or anything involving robotics, automation, and edge computing.
